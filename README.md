# conflict_portal

The conflict of interest portal has been designed as a wordpress plugin. 

Upon installation of the plugin the appropriate files are registered with Wordpress and the database tables are added to MySQL. A new menu will become available within the Wordpress Admin screen named “Conflict of Interest”

The Conflict of Interest menu is where the conflict items can be modified, including all text, titles and sequencing of the conflict questionnaire. This menu also contains a search function for retrieving stored conflict results in the case of audit.

When a new user enters the portal, a unique secure session ID is created and used to reference each of the inputs entered during the questionnaire. 

The user will enter yes/no to each of the conflict questions and at the end of the questionnaire they will be presented with their results. The user will then be prompted if they would like to save the results. If the user enters an email on the “save results” page they will also be sent a copy of their survey for their reference.
